# Release Management

These notes cover how to release and deploy the three primary apps, i.e. [service](https://github.com/clearlydefined/service), [website](https://github.com/clearlydefined/website), and [crawler](https://github.com/clearlydefined/crawler).

_NOTE: All apps are transitioning to use Semantic Versioning, as described below, and to use GitHub actions for deploying.  This documentation will be changing as that effort proceeds, so check back here before every release and deploy._

## TLDR; Understanding Semantic Versioning

_If you are not familiar with Semantic Versioning, you are encouraged to read the [official documentation](https://semver.org/) for the full description._

Semantic Versioning track three levels of change in the version number (e.g. v2.3.4)

**MAJOR:** _from v2.3.4 to v3.0.0_

The first number increments if there is a breaking change meaning that the consumer cannot use this version without taking additional steps (Examples: new feature that is required, database schema changes, file format changes, changes to signatures/output of public methods, API changes, etc.)

_NOTE: To limit the number of MAJOR releases, consider using deprecation.  With deprecation, users can use either the old approach or the new one.  If the old code is used, a deprecation message is logged advising an update to the new approach.  When a MAJOR release is required, all deprecated code is removed._

**MINOR:** _from v2.3.4 to v2.4.0_

The second number increments if there is a minor change and no MAJOR changes (Examples: new feature that is optional, changes to signatures/output of private methods, new API endpoint, etc.)

**PATCH:** _from v2.3.4 to v2.3.5_

The third number increments if there are only trivial changes that do not impact processing  and there aren't any MAJOR or MINOR changes (Examples: bug fixes, documentation changes, fixing typos, etc.)

**Pre-release:**

Pre-releases append a confidence indicator. The initial confidence level (e.g. alpha, beta, rc for release candidate) is assigned without a number.  If an additional release is made at that same confidence level, a sequential number starting at 1 is added after a period.

* alpha (e.g. 3.0.0-alpha, 3.0.0-alpha.1) is the lowest confidence level, typically assigned before all functionality is complete
* beta (e.g. 3.0.0-beta, 3.0.0-beta-1) is the middle confidence level, typically assigned once all features are complete, but not fully tested
* rc (e.g. 3.0.0-rc, 3.0.0-rc.1) is a full feature release candidate.  This is used during the final stages of release testing.  It is expected to be feature complete and may become the next published release if testing is good.

## Common steps for releasing

1. Decide the appropriate version for the new release following Semantic Versioning
   * if no testing has been done, the recommendation is to set a beta release (e.g. v2.4.0-alpha.2, v2.4.0-beta.1)
   * if testing is looking good, but not fully complete, set a release candidate (e.g. v2.4.0-rc.3)
   * when testing is complete, set the release version (e.g. v2.4.0)
2. In all cases, update the version in the package system using `npm-version` (e.g. `npm-version v2.4.0-rc.3`)
3. In all cases, create a tag for the code using the version number as the tag (e.g. v2.4.0-rc.3).
4. This is a good time to write the release notes, even if this is a beta or release candidate.  See [How to create Release Notes](#how-to-create-release-notes) for information on the structure of the notes.  Writing the these early will help identify what needs to be tested. Save the notes outside of GitHub (e.g. Google Docs). 
5. Create the release
   * For beta or release candidates versions:
     * create a pre-release using the tag created previously (e.g. v2.4.0-rc.3)
     * for the notes, only include the link that does the diff (e.g. for the service app, it will be something like `Changes: [v2.3.4...v2.4.0-rc.3](https://github.com/clearlydefined/service/compare/v2.3.4...https://github.com/clearlydefined/service/compare/v2.4.0-rc.3)`)
     * BE SURE TO CHECK THE `Set as a pre-release`
     * BE SURE THAT `Set as the latest release` WAS UNCHECKED automatically
   * For the full release:
     * create a published release using the tag created previously (e.g. v2.4.0)
     * for the notes, use the full set of release notes
     * check or uncheck `Set as the latest release` as needed
6. The next step is to Deploy.  The Deploy process varies between the apps.  All apps are moving to use the same process, but do not at this writing.  See the Deploy process for each app below in the [Deploy](#deploy) section.
7. Test deploy.  For pre-releases, full testing to determine if they are ready to be published.  For published release, test to be sure the deploy was successful.

## Accepatance Test

End-to-end integration tests have been implemented to ensure that the functionalities of the [service API](https://api.clearlydefined.io/api-docs/#) work as expected. Further effort is required to enhance the test suite and cover more cases and error handling.

To manually trigger the integration tests, you can use [GitHub Actions in the operations repository](https://github.com/clearlydefined/operations/actions/workflows/integration-test.yml). If you run the tests on the main branch, all the tests committed to that branch will be executed. By default, the integration tests compare the results from the development deployment with the production deployment. You can configure the development and production deployments in testConfig.js.

The current tests include:

- Harvesting components that are supported by ClearlyDefined.
- Retrieving information from the harvest store through the /harvest API.
- Computing and retrieving definitions for coordinates through the /definitions API.
- Searching for definitions for coordinates through the GET /definitions API.
- Curating components through the PATCH /curations API.
- Retrieving curation information through the /curations API.
- Previewing definitions with curation through the /definitions API.
- Retrieving attachments through the /attachments API.
- Generating notices for all component types supported by ClearlyDefined through the POST /notices API (in progress)

## Get the list of PRs since the last release

* open terminal
* navigate to clearlydefined/operations
* run command

```bash
node tools/release-scripts/lib/getPRs.mjs <repo> <tag-latest-release> prod <repo-public-gh-pat>
```

Substitutions:

* `<repo>` - one of the primary apps (i.e. `service`, `webapp`, `crawler`)
* `<tag-latest-release>` - tag of the latest release for the primary app
* `<repo-public-gh-pat>` - your GitHub personal access token (PAT) with permissions for public repos

Output:

This will output a list of PRs including title, PR #, PR authors. 

Example output:

```md
- Use dependency injection in PypiCoordinatesMapper (#1072) (@qtomlinson)
- Use URL object to generate request URL (#1066) (@lumaxis)
- add GitHub action for deploy of production service (#1051) (@elrayle)
```

## Create Release Notes

The release notes should follow this basic pattern...

_NOTE: Anywhere there is a list of PRs, the format follows that returned by getPRs.  See section [Get the list of PRs since the last release](#get-the-list-of-prs-since-the-last-release). Copy and paste the PRs from the list into the release notes._

```md
## Release Highlights

Release tag: [v1.0.0](https://github.com/clearlydefined/service/tree/v1.0.0)

Brief overview of the major impact of the release.

## Upgrade Notes

Describe any actions required to be able to use this version.  For example, instructions for running a database migration, how to process changes in file formats, etc.

## Deploy

The steps to deploy vary by application.  Follow the steps for the application you are deploying.

_NOTE: All apps are transitioning to use Semantic Versioning, as described above, and to use GitHub actions for deploying.  This notes will be changing, so check back here before every release and deploy._

### Service

The code for the Service app lives in the [clearlydefined/service](https://github.com/clearlydefined/service) repository.  The base name for the app in the Azure App Services is `clearlydefined-api`.

#### dev deploy

A GitHub action is triggered by merging into the `master` branch.  The action deploys that branch to `clearlydefined-api-dev` app.

You can also deploy manually.  This is commonly used to test a PR branch before merging.

* go to the [Build and Deploy to dev service app](https://github.com/clearlydefined/service/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy-dev.yml) action
* click `Run workflow` drop down
* click the `Branch: master` drop down
* select the branch or tag you want to deploy
* click `Run workflow` button.

#### prod deploy

A GitHub action is triggered when a release is `published`.  The action deploys [prod](https://github.com/clearlydefined/service/tree/prod) branch to `clearlydefined-api-prod` app.

You can also deploy manually.  This is uncommon.  Production is setup to run the latest release.  This might be used if something goes wrong after a new release is deployed to revert to the previous production release.

* go to the [Build and Deploy to prod service app](https://github.com/clearlydefined/service/actions/workflows/build_and_deploy_prod.yml) action
* click `Run workflow` drop down
* click the `Branch: master` drop down
* select the previous known good release's tag
* click `Run workflow` button.

## Verification After Deployment

After the deployment, API calls can be made to the service for verification purposes. The collection of sample API calls can be found at [tools/integration/api-test](./tools/integration/api-test).

Here are some steps to get started:

1. To ensure that the service is up and running, perform a ping/health check and confirm the build SHA of the deployment.
2. Use the [POST call to /harvest](https://api.clearlydefined.io/api-docs/#/harvest/post_harvest) to add a new component for harvesting. You can find an example of this API call in the `harvest` folder of the sample collection. Replace the request body with the details of the new component. Please note that components that have already been harvested are usually skipped during the harvest process.
3. To confirm that the component has been successfully harvested, you can either inspect the harvest store (such as Blob Storage) or make a [GET call to /harvest](https://api.clearlydefined.io/api-docs/#/harvest/get_harvest__type___provider___namespace___name___revision_). You can find examples of the API call in the `harvest` folder of the sample collection. Keep in mind that depending on the number of items in the queue, it may take some time for the harvest to be completed.
4. Verify the definition of the component by making a [GET call to /definitions](https://api.clearlydefined.io/api-docs/#/definitions/get_definitions__type___provider___namespace___name___revision_). Examples of this call can be found in the `definitions` folder of the sample collection.  Alternatively, you can also verify the definition through the ClearlyDefined website, e.g. https://clearlydefined.io/definitions/npm/npmjs/@types/aws-lambda/8.10.137, along with the corresponding coordinates.
5. Verify the notice generation by making a [POST call to /notices](https://api.clearlydefined.io/api-docs/#/notices/post_notices). You can find an example of this call in the `notices` folder of the sample api-test collection.
6. Check the [website](https://clearlydefined.io/) to ensure that the recently harvested list is populated. You can click on the components listed there to verify their definitions.
